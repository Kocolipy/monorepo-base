# CONTEXT

Glossary of the terms this codebase uses for its own concepts. Seeded lazily —
a term lands here when a decision actually resolves it, so absence of a term
means nobody has needed to pin it down yet, not that the concept is undefined.

Use these words in code, tests, commit messages and issues. Where a synonym is
listed as avoided, it is avoided because it already means something else here.

## Request paths

**Reserved server path** — a request path the backend answers for itself:
`/api` and `/actuator`, each reserving both the exact path and everything
beneath it. Reserved paths are authenticated by the filter chain and keep their
own error responses. `SpaRoutes.isReservedServerPath` is the only place the list
lives.

**SPA shell** — `index.html`, the single document the single-page application
boots from. A path with no server-side handler is _forwarded to the shell_ when
it belongs to the client-side router, which is how a deep link such as
`/account/settings` survives a page reload.

**File request** — a path whose **last** segment contains a dot
(`/assets/index-a1b2c3.js`, `/favicon.ico`). A missing file request stays a 404;
it is never answered with the SPA shell, or a broken asset URL would return HTML
with a 200. A dot in an earlier segment (`/v1.0/settings`) does not make a path
one.

Avoid "frontend route" as a term: it blurred two different questions — whether a
path may be served without authentication (true of file requests) and whether a
missing path should become the shell (false of them) — which is how two modules
came to implement it twice and disagree.

## Sessions

**Session status** — what the SPA currently knows about the visitor's session:
`checking` before the one start-up check has answered, then `authenticated` or
`guest`. It is a _condition_, not an event, which is why a session ending is not
a fourth member. `resolveSessionRoute` is the only place the status decides what
a route does.

**Guest** — a visitor with no session. The status a cold arrival starts in, and
the one a sign-out returns to.

**Expired session** — a session that _was_ authenticated and which the backend
has since refused with a `401`. The status becomes `guest` either way; what
distinguishes an expired session is its provenance, carried as `sessionExpired`
and passed into the redirect so the login route can say the session ended rather
than greeting a stranger. A persistent `403` is **not** an expired session — that
is a stale CSRF token, and the session survives it.

**Return destination** — the protected path a visitor asked for before being
redirected to sign in, recorded as `from` in router state and replayed once the
status turns `authenticated`. Owned by the route guards, so no page navigates on
its own behalf after signing in.

## Accounts and roles

**Visitor** — an unauthenticated person. A Visitor may use only the login page;
asking for a protected route records the return destination and sends them there.

**User** — an authenticated account whose role is `USER`. A User may use the
counter page at `/showcase` but not account administration.

**Admin** — an authenticated account whose role is `ADMIN`. An Admin may use the
counter page and the placeholder accounts page at `/accounts`.

**Account** — a database-backed login identity with one username, encoded
password, and role. Startup seeding creates the configured User and Admin only
when their usernames are absent; it does not overwrite an existing account.
