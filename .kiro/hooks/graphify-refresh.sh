# Kiro `stop` hook: refresh the knowledge graph at the end of a turn in which
# code or docs actually changed.
#
# Why `stop` and not a commit hook: AGENTS.md wants the graph refreshed in the
# same change that caused it, and agents mostly do not commit -- the human does.
# `stop` fires at the one boundary every agent reliably hits: the end of the
# turn, just before it reports done.
#
# Cost: `graphify update` is AST-only, no LLM, no API spend. This script runs it
# as a plain subprocess -- no model tokens are consumed. The graphify-runner
# agent (.kiro/agents/graphify-runner.json) is for the cases that need judgment,
# which this script refuses to guess at (see the failure path at the bottom).
#
# Fails open: any missing prerequisite exits 0 so a turn is never held hostage
# to graph tooling.
