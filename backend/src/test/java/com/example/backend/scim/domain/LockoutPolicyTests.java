/**
 * The lockout policy's one invariant: at least one attempt has to be possible.
 *
 * <p>This test exists because the assertion it makes was LOST. It lived in {@code AccountTests}
 * as {@code aPolicyMustAllowAtLeastOneAttempt}, and when {@code LockoutPolicy} moved from
 * {@code auth.domain} into this slice — following the authentication state it governs — the class
 * was translated and the assertion was not. Nothing anywhere constructed an invalid policy
 * afterwards, so the guard was unexercised while the build stayed green. That is the "translated
 * the class, dropped the assertion" failure mode, and this file is the repair.
 *
 * <p>Load-bearing rather than defensive: {@code maxAttempts} comes from deployment configuration,
 * so a zero or a negative value is a real thing an operator can write. Without the guard a zero
 * would mean the very first login attempt already exceeds the allowance, locking every User out of
 * a freshly configured deployment — including, but for its exemption, the recovery identity.
