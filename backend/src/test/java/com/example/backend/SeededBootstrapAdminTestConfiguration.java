/**
 * Tests start from a deployment whose operator has already completed the Bootstrap Admin's
 * first-login password change.
 *
 * <p>Seeding flags the Bootstrap Admin, because its configured password is a default credential,
 * and a flagged session is confined to the change flow. Every integration test that administers
 * the directory logs in as the seeded {@code test-admin} with its configured password, so without
 * this each one would first have to change that password — which would then differ from the one
 * the next class sharing the cached context logs in with.
 *
 * <p>So the flag is cleared through the real {@link ScimUserRepository#completePasswordChange}
 * port, keeping the same hash: the state a deployment is in after its operator rotated the
 * credential, minus the rotation. It runs on {@link ApplicationReadyEvent}, which fires after every
 * {@code ApplicationRunner} — seeding included — has finished.
 *
 * <p>What this hides is asserted elsewhere: {@code ScimSeedServiceTests} pins that seeding sets
 * the flag, and the confinement of a flagged session has its own integration tests.
