 * Why an administrative change was refused, as a closed set.

 * <p>A closed set for the reason {@link AuditRefusalReason} is one: the reason is a field
 * every later query groups by, and a free-text reason is a place a caller's own value could
 * be written. These are refusals about the ACTION rather than about the caller — the caller
 * is an authenticated administrator in every case — so none of them is an authorization
 * failure and none is recorded as one.
 *
 * <p>Refusals are recorded and not merely logged because each of them is an attempt to
 * remove the deployment's last way back in. A run of them is the signal worth having, and a
 * log line that carries no subject id cannot be correlated to the identity it was about.
