/**
 * Names the retention job for the scheduled-job module ({@link ScheduledJobMetrics#schedule}):
 * its cron, what it does, and the retention period its startup record states.
 *
 * <p>The cron is evaluated in {@link ServiceTimeZone#ZONE}, the zone the service's log
 * timestamps are written in, so "03:30" is the 03:30 an operator reads in the job's own
 * records rather than 03:30 in whatever zone the host defaults to.
 *
 * <p>Registered through {@link SchedulingConfigurer} rather than with
 * {@code @Scheduled(cron = "...")} because that annotation's value must be a
 * constant expression: the cron would have to be repeated as a property
 * placeholder instead of read from {@link AuditRetentionPolicy}, which already
 * owns it and its default.
 *
 * <p>The schedule is logged at registration rather than inside the job. A job only logs once
 * it runs, and the first thing an operator needs to know — after a deploy, and
 * before anything has aged out — is when rows will start disappearing.
