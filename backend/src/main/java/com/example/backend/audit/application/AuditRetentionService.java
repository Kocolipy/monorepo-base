/**
 * Enforces the retention window: one pass that removes every event older than it.
 *
 * <p>Each run reports what it did — how many rows it removed — because a retention
 * job is otherwise the one thing in the service whose correct behaviour and total
 * failure look identical from outside. A run that deletes nothing is logged too:
 * "nothing had aged out" and "the job has not run for a month" are different facts
 * and an operator needs to be able to tell them apart. The run's start, its end, how
 * long it took and whether it failed are {@code ScheduledJobMetrics}' to log, around
 * this record; scheduled through it, this record carries the run's
 * {@code batch.job.run.id}.
 *
 * <h2>Serialization</h2>
 *
 * <p>A run takes the job's own lock ({@link ScheduledJob#AUDIT_RETENTION}) first, so two
 * instances on the same cron do not both delete: the second finds the lock held, does
 * nothing, and reports it {@linkplain AuditRetentionRun#skipped skipped}, which
 * {@code ScheduledJobMetrics.instrumentLocked} logs as the run's {@code lock-held} end. The
 * lock is taken before the adapter assumes the retention role, as the application's own
 * role, which is the one granted it.
 *
 * <p>{@code @Transactional} is load-bearing rather than incidental. The lock is held for
 * the rest of the transaction, and the adapter assumes the retention database role with
 * {@code SET LOCAL ROLE}, which needs a transaction to be local to; without one the delete
 * would run as the application's own role and be refused.
