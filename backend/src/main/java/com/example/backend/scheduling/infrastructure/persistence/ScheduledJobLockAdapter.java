/**
 * Serializes each scheduled job on its own row of {@code scheduled_job_locks}.
 *
 * <p>{@code FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED} is the whole mechanism. The row lock is held until the
 * calling transaction ends, so a second run of the same job — in this process or another one
 * against the same database — skips the row and learns it is not the one to run, without
 * waiting. A run of the other job locks a different row and never sees this one.
 *
 * <p>JDBC rather than JPA: the row has no attributes worth mapping, and the statement is a lock,
 * not a read. It joins the caller's transaction through the shared data source.
