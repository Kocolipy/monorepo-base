 *
 * <p>Two questions, because the callers ask different ones. The filter chain
 * asks whether a path is reserved for the server, so that everything else —
 * the HTML shell and the hashed asset bundle alike — is served without
 * authentication. The error view resolver asks whether a missing path should
 * be handed to the client-side router instead of returning 404, which is only
 * true of paths that do not look like a file request: a missing asset must stay
 * a 404 rather than quietly become HTML.
 *
 * <p>Both questions share one reserved-prefix list, which is the knowledge that
 * was previously authored twice. A new reserved prefix is added here, once.
