/**
 * The one record a request refused for want of authentication ({@code 401}) or of
 * authorization ({@code 403}) gets, from either security chain.
 *
 * <p>The record says THAT access was refused, to whom and to which operation — the caller's
 * {@code user.id} or {@code scim.connector.id} from the logging context, the method, the route
 * template — and why only in a word from {@link Refusal}'s closed set. It never says which
 * rule refused it: no role, no matcher, no authority. A record naming the role a route needs
 * is a map of the authorization rules for whoever reads the log stream. It never carries a
 * credential either, nor any part of one: the reasons are fixed strings, so nothing a caller
 * sent can reach the record through them.
 *
 * <h2>Once per request</h2>
 *
 * <p>Only on the request dispatch, and only the first time. A refusal answered with
 * {@code sendError} is dispatched again to the error page; should that dispatch ever be refused
 * by a chain too — a filter registered for error dispatches, a rule the error page does not
 * pass — it is the same exchange, not a second refusal, and gets no second record.
 * {@code RefusalLogIntegrationTests} observes one record per refusal over a real socket today;
 * this guard keeps it so if the error dispatch's handling changes.
 * {@code #68}'s request record exists beside this one and is a different record: that one
 * says a request ended, this one says why it was turned away.
