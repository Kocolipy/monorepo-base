/**
 * Who the current request was authenticated as, carried out of the security chain to the

 *
 * <p>{@code user.id} and {@code scim.connector.id} are put in the logging context by filters
 * INSIDE the security chain, and each scope closes as the chain unwinds. The request record is
 * written by {@link RequestIdFilter}, which runs outside the chain so that a refusal by it is
 * recorded too — so by then both ids are gone from the context. The filter that resolves the
 * caller says so here as well, and {@link RequestIdFilter} puts the ids back in scope for the
 * one record it writes.
 *
 * <p>Kept on the request rather than in the logging context, for the reason
 * {@link RequestFault} is: the mark has to outlive the inner filter's scope. Only ids are
 * kept, already resolved by the filter that knows how — never a userName or anything of a
 * presented credential. A request that is anonymous, or refused before it authenticated,
 * never has either mark, so its record carries neither field.
