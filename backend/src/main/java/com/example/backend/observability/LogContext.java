/**
 * The only way anything in this service writes to the logging context.
 *
 * <p>Logs carry correlation ids and nothing else. A {@code userName}, a filter
 * expression, a password, a bearer value, a hash and a cookie value never reach a
 * log line — neither in a message nor as a context entry — because a log store is
 * read by more people, retained longer, and shipped further than the database the
 * value came from. That rule cannot be enforced by review of {@code MDC.put}
 * call sites scattered across the service, so there are none: this class exposes
 * five named setters and no general-purpose one, and
 * {@code ArchitectureTest.mdc_is_only_touched_by_the_log_context} holds it to
 * being the single class in production code that touches {@link MDC}.
 *
 * <p>Four keys are the ones the identity surface needs to correlate by, and
 * all four are ids rather than values:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #REQUEST_ID} — minted per inbound request by
 *       {@link RequestIdFilter}, never taken from the caller.
 *   <li>{@link #USER_ID} — the stable SCIM id of the authenticated User the
 *       record concerns, never its userName or email. Typed as a {@link UUID} so
 *       a readable identifier cannot be passed by mistake. Absent wherever the
 *       identity is not resolved — a refused login above all.
 *   <li>{@link #CONNECTOR_ID} — which provisioning connector's token
 *       authenticated the request, once connectors exist.
 *   <li>{@link #RESOURCE_ID} — the stable id of the resource being acted on,
 *       which is why it is an id: the resource's readable identifiers are exactly
 *       what must not be logged.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The fifth setter, {@link #job}, is the scheduled-job run's identity, written as one
 * unit by {@link ScheduledJobMetrics#instrumentLocked} for the run's lifetime:
 * {@link #JOB_NAME} (a constant from code), {@link #JOB_RUN_ID} (a UUID minted per run)
 * and {@link #TRIGGER_TYPE} (always {@value #TRIGGER_SCHEDULED}). None of the three is a
 * value anything outside the service supplies.
 *
 * <p>Two more keys exist beside these, {@link #TRACE_ID} and {@link #SPAN_ID}, and this
 * class does not write them: the tracer does, for each span's scope. They are tracer-minted
 * hex ids rather than values anything else supplies, which is why they can come from a
 * library without weakening the rule above.
 *
 * <p>Every value is passed through {@link #sanitize} first. A value that reaches
 * here can still be client-influenced further out — a connector id read from a
 * token, a resource id parsed from a path — and a newline or a carriage return
 * inside one would let a caller close the current log record and forge the next
 * (CWE-117). Structured output makes that harder, not impossible: the sanitizing
 * is what makes it impossible.
