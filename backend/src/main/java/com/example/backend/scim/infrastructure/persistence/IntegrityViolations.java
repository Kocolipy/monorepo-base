 * <p>{@link DataIntegrityViolationException} covers every refusal the database makes about the
 * data — a taken unique value, but also a value too long for its column, a missing NOT NULL value
 * and a dangling foreign key. Translating the exception TYPE to "the name is taken" reported each
 * of those to a connector as a {@code 409 uniqueness} it would then try to resolve by linking to
 * an account that does not exist. Matching the constraint's NAME is what makes the translation
 * true: the names are the ones the migrations declare, so a rename there is a change here.
