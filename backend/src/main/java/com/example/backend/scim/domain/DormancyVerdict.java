 * User's dormancy is measured from, both cutoffs, and the comparison — so the job asks this one
 * question for both of its steps and holds no copy of the rule. Because the windows are ordered
 * (role revocation is the later step), a User past the role-revocation window is always past the
 * lockout window too: there is no "role revocation without lockout".
