/**
 * Establishes the deployment's recovery path on a database that does not have one: the Bootstrap
 * Admin, the Admin group, and the Bootstrap Admin's membership of it.
 *
 * <p>This is the only writer of a reservation marker. A reserved resource cannot be created by any
 * provisioning path — the ports expose {@code createReserved} operations that only this class
 * calls, and the marker column is not updatable — so the recovery resources exist because this ran
 * and for no other reason.
 *
 * <h2>Idempotent by looking first, under a lock</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every write is preceded by a read that decides whether it is needed, and no write is ever
 * expected to fail. That is deliberate: against Postgres a unique-key violation aborts the whole
 * transaction and marks it rollback-only, so a seed that INSERTed and caught the violation as
 * "it is already there" failed every restart against a seeded database. Catching does not undo
 * the abort.
 *
 * <p>Read-then-write alone would let two instances starting together both read "absent", so the
 * transaction first takes {@link ScimSeedLock}. The second instance waits, then reads what the
 * first committed and writes nothing. The reservations stay UNIQUE in the schema as the backstop:
 * if the lock were ever bypassed, the outcome is a failed startup, never two Admin groups.
 *
 * <h2>The ordinary identity is a first-run convenience</h2>
 *
 * <p>The ordinary configured identity is created only in the run that creates the Bootstrap Admin
 * — that is, on a database seeding has never completed on. Afterwards it is an ordinary,
 * provisionable User: a connector or administrator that deletes or renames it has made a
 * deliberate change, and a restart that brought it back would undo that change. The recovery
 * path is different, which is why it alone is re-checked on every start.
 *
 * <h2>What it does not do</h2>
 *
 * <p>It never overwrites. A Bootstrap Admin that exists keeps its password, its failure run and
 * its lock — whatever the operator and the login path made them — because a restart that silently
 * reset the recovery credential to the configured one would undo a deliberate rotation.
 *
 * <p>It does not reconcile. If the reserved User exists but has been removed from the Admin group,
 * the membership is restored, because that membership is the deployment's authority and the SCIM
 * surface refuses to remove it — so its absence means something outside SCIM removed it, and
 * leaving it absent would leave a recovery identity with no authority to recover with.
