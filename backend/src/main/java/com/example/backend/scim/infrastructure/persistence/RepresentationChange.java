/**
 * Which resources' rendered documents a SCIM write changed, and so whose version — and ETag —
 * it advances.
 *
 * <p>One rule, decided here and nowhere else: <em>every resource whose representation a write
 * changed advances its version exactly once, and no other resource advances.</em> The adapters
 * describe the write — the membership before and after, the old and new name, what was deleted
 * — through one of the factories below, and {@link #advanceIn} carries the decision out. No
 * adapter names the ids itself, because a call site that had to work out who moved is a call
 * site that eventually forgets one: Group create with members once advanced none of them, and
 * a miss is silent — a connector keeps a stale ETag rather than receiving an error.
 *
 * <p>Where a Group's change shows up in a User's document, and the reverse:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A User's rendered {@code groups} lists every Group it belongs to, with the Group's
 *       {@code displayName} as the label. So a membership that starts or stops changes that
 *       User, and a Group rename changes every User still in it.
 *   <li>A Group's rendered {@code members} lists its Users. So a User deleted out of a Group
 *       changes the Group.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Pure: it decides from the sets it is given and touches nothing until {@link #advanceIn},
 * which issues at most one statement. Locking is not its concern — the caller has already locked
 * the resource row it is writing, and the bulk update locks the rest in the order it always did.
