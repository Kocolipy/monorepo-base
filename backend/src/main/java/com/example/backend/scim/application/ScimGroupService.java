/**
 * Creating, reading, changing and deleting SCIM Groups, as a connector asks for it.
 *
 * <p>Every method takes the {@link AuthenticatedConnector} rather than reading it from a
 * security context, for the two reasons {@link ScimUserService} does: an {@code externalId} is
 * connector-scoped, so a read that did not know who was asking could not resolve the alias,
 * and an audit event names the acting connector, so making the actor a parameter means no code
 * path exists that records a SCIM operation with no actor.
 *
 * <h2>What a Group write may not do</h2>
 *
 * <p>Two resources are reserved for the deployment's recovery, and the refusals below are the
 * whole of their protection on this surface:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The <strong>Admin group</strong> — the Superuser Group, whose Role holds every
 *       Permission — may not be renamed and may not be deleted. Its ordinary membership stays
 *       writable, because granting and revoking access is exactly what external provisioning is
 *       for. Every other mapped Group is an ordinary Group on this surface: renamable,
 *       deletable, its membership writable.
 *   <li>The <strong>Bootstrap Admin's</strong> membership is frozen — it cannot be removed
 *       from the Admin group, and it cannot be added to or removed from any other Group.
 *       The glossary's rule is that no SCIM operation may mutate that User, and a membership
 *       change does mutate it: it moves the User's computed {@code groups} attribute and
 *       advances its version, which a client reads.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The calling connector's own {@code externalId} on the Admin group stays writable. It is that
 * connector's name for the Group, not part of the Group, and no other connector reads it, so
 * changing it neither renames the recovery authority nor alters who holds it — and an IdP that
 * re-keys its objects must be able to keep finding the Group it manages.
 *
 * <p>Every refusal is raised before anything is written, so a refused write changes nothing —
 * which is what makes "verified by re-reading unchanged" a property of this class rather than
 * of a test's luck. Each is audited, and the audit append is deliberately the fail-open kind:
 * the refusal rolls this transaction back, so an append that joined it would be rolled back
 * with it, and an attempt to provision the recovery authority away would leave no trace.
 *
 * <h2>A mapped Group's membership is Role assignment</h2>
 *
 * <p>A Group the role mapping names confers its Role on every direct member, so writing its
 * membership is assigning that Role — which is why {@code group:write} on a mapped Group is as
 * powerful as the Role itself. Every write that moves a mapped Group's membership is therefore
 * also recorded as a change of power: a {@code ROLE_GRANT} for each User it added and a
 * {@code ROLE_REVOKE} for each User it removed, naming the User, the Group and the Role, and a
 * matching {@code INFO} record in the application log.
 *
 * <p>A session carries the Permissions it was issued with, so a User removed from a mapped Group
 * would otherwise keep that Role's Permissions for the rest of its lifetime. Every write that drops
 * a direct member of a mapped Group — a PATCH {@code remove}, a PATCH {@code replace} of the
 * members, a PUT whose member list leaves the User out, or the Group's DELETE — therefore ends that
 * User's sessions through {@link ScimUserSessions}, which does so only once the write commits. A
 * refused, stale or rolled-back write revokes nothing; neither does a removal from a Group the
 * mapping does not name, which confers nothing, nor an ADDITION to a mapped Group, whose Role
 * the User holds from its next sign-in.
 *
 * <p>Which Users gain or lose a Role, and whose Sessions end, is decided by
 * {@link ScimWriteEffects} from the membership before and after; this class carries it out.
