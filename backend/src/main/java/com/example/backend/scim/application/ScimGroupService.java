/**
 * Creating, reading, changing and deleting SCIM Groups, as a connector asks for it.
 *
 * <p>Every method takes the {@link AuthenticatedConnector} rather than reading it from a
 * security context, for the two reasons {@link ScimUserService} does: an {@code externalId} is
 * connector-scoped, so a read that did not know who was asking could not resolve the alias,
 * and an audit event names the acting connector, so making the actor a parameter means no code
 * path exists that records a SCIM operation with no actor.
 *
 * <h2>What a Group write may not do</h2>
 *
 * <p>Two resources are reserved for the deployment's recovery, and the refusals below are the
 * whole of their protection on this surface:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The <strong>Admin group</strong> may not be renamed and may not be deleted. Its
 *       ordinary membership stays writable, because granting and revoking administrative
 *       access is exactly what external provisioning is for.
 *   <li>The <strong>Bootstrap Admin's</strong> membership is frozen — it cannot be removed
 *       from the Admin group, and it cannot be added to or removed from any other Group.
 *       The glossary's rule is that no SCIM operation may mutate that User, and a membership
 *       change does mutate it: it moves the User's computed {@code groups} attribute and
 *       advances its version, which a client reads.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The calling connector's own {@code externalId} on the Admin group stays writable. It is that
 * connector's name for the Group, not part of the Group, and no other connector reads it, so
 * changing it neither renames the recovery authority nor alters who holds it — and an IdP that
 * re-keys its objects must be able to keep finding the Group it manages.
 *
 * <p>Every refusal is raised before anything is written, so a refused write changes nothing —
 * which is what makes "verified by re-reading unchanged" a property of this class rather than
 * of a test's luck. Each is audited, and the audit append is deliberately the fail-open kind:
 * the refusal rolls this transaction back, so an append that joined it would be rolled back
 * with it, and an attempt to provision the recovery authority away would leave no trace.
