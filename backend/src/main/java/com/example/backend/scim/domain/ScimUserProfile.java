/**
 * Everything a SCIM User is apart from its identity, its credential and its
 * version: the profile attributes a connector writes and reads back.
 *
 * <p>Grouped into a record of its own, and not spread across {@link ScimUser}'s
 * components, because this is exactly the set a replacement writes. A PUT replaces
 * the profile and leaves the id, the version lineage and the password alone; having
 * one value that means "the profile" is what lets that be stated as one assignment
 * rather than as a list of fields a future edit can fall out of step with.
 *
 * <p>The canonical constructor is where the multi-valued and complex attributes are
 * brought into their stored form, so no caller can construct a profile that the
 * database would refuse: {@code emails} is de-duplicated and reduced to at most one
 * primary, {@code name} becomes {@link ScimName#NONE} rather than null, and an
 * absent {@code emails} becomes an empty list rather than null. A domain object that
 * can hold a shape the schema forbids is a defect waiting for a caller.
 *
 * @param userName          the login and lookup attribute, as submitted
 * @param name              the complex name attribute, never null
 * @param displayName       primary human-readable label, or null
 * @param preferredLanguage language-priority value, or null
 * @param locale            language tag, or null
 * @param timezone          IANA time-zone identifier, or null
 * @param active            whether the User may authenticate
