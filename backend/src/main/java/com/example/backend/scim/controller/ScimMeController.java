/**
 * {@code /Me}, answered {@code 501} for every method.
 *
 * <p>RFC 7644 §3.11 defines {@code /Me} as an alias for the User the caller authenticated as. A
 * connector is not a User: its token represents a directory, not an end User, so there is no
 * resource the alias could name. The endpoint is mapped rather than left to fall through to a
 * {@code 404}, because a {@code 404} would tell a client the path does not exist when what is true
 * is that this provider does not offer the operation — which is what {@code 501} says.
 *
 * <p>Behind authentication like every non-discovery path: an unauthenticated caller learns no more
 * here than anywhere else in the namespace.
