/**
 * One thing a SCIM PATCH asks to be done to a Group, as a closed set.
 *
 * <p>Sealed, and that is the design. RFC 7644 §3.5.2 defines PATCH as operations over
 * attribute paths, which is an open-ended grammar; a Group in this directory has exactly three
 * writable attributes — {@code displayName}, {@code members} and the calling connector's
 * {@code externalId} — so the set of things a PATCH can actually mean is small and finite.
 * Naming each of them is what lets the use case apply a PATCH as a fold over typed values
 * instead of interpreting paths at the point of writing — and what makes an unsupported path
 * a refusal at the adapter, where the request is still a request, rather than a surprise
 * deeper in.
 *
 * <p>Each variant carries resolved ids rather than the submitted JSON, so nothing below the
 * adapter parses anything. A member id that is not a UUID is not representable here at all.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately absent: any operation on {@code id}, {@code meta} or the reverse
 * membership view. They are read-only, and the way this refuses them is by having no variant
 * they could be expressed as.
