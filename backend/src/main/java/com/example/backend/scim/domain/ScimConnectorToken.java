/**
 * One connector token, as this service stores it.
 *
 * <p>There is no field the plaintext value could be written into. That is the
 * "shown once" rule expressed as a shape: what is minted is handed to the issue or
 * rotation response and then exists nowhere, so this service cannot become a
 * secret-retrieval system even for an administrator who asks nicely.
 *
 * <p>{@code expiresAt} and {@code originalExpiresAt} are two fields rather than
 * one because rotation moves the first and must never move the second. Keeping the
 * issued expiry means "rotation never extended this token" is checkable against
 * the row — the database checks exactly that, in
 * {@code ck_scim_connector_tokens_expiry_never_extended}.
 *
 * @param id                stable identity, assigned before the row exists
 * @param connectorId       the connector this token authenticates
 * @param lookupId          the non-secret half of the presented value
 * @param digest            SHA-256 of the complete presented value
 * @param scope             what the token authorises, directory-wide
 * @param issuedAt          when it was minted
 * @param expiresAt         when it stops being accepted; may be brought forward by
 *                          rotation, never pushed back
 * @param originalExpiresAt the expiry it was issued with
 * @param revokedAt         when it was revoked, or {@code null}
 * @param replacedByTokenId the token that replaced this one in a rotation, or
 *                          {@code null}
