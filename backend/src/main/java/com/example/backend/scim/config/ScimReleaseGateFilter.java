/**
 * Makes the SCIM namespace unreachable while the release gate is closed.
 *
 * <p>Ordered first in the SCIM chain, ahead of authentication, so a closed gate is the
 * answer to every request whatever credential it carries. That ordering is what makes the
 * gate a statement about the namespace rather than about authorisation: a valid token, an
 * expired one and none at all all get the same answer, so the gate cannot be probed for
 * whether the interface exists behind it.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@code 404}, not {@code 403} or {@code 503}.</strong> A {@code 403} would say
 * "this exists and you may not have it" and a {@code 503} would say "come back later"; both
 * disclose a surface that is not being offered. A {@code 404} says the path is not served
 * here, which is the truth while the gate is closed.
 *
 * <p>The body is a SCIM error document rather than empty, for one reason that is worth the
 * few bytes: the gated answer must be impossible to confuse with the single-page
 * application's HTML shell, which is what a reserved-path mistake would produce with a
 * {@code 200}. A caller can tell the two apart from the body alone.
