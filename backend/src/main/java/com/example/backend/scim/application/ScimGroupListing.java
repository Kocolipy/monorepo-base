 * One page of Groups, with the total the page was taken from.

 * because that is what SCIM's {@code ListResponse} means by it and what a client pages
 * against. The two are carried together so a renderer cannot report the page's size as the
 * total — which would make the first page look like the whole directory.
 *
 * @param resources    the page, in the port's stable order
 * @param totalResults how many Groups exist, irrespective of the page
 * @param page         the coerced paging parameters the page was taken with
