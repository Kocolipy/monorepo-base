/**
 * How long a User may go without authenticating before each step of the dormancy job applies to
 * it (ADR 0011).
 *
 * <p>Two windows, both measured on the same basis — {@link #basis}, the last successful login,
 * completed password change, explicit reactivation or Unlock, falling back to creation — and
 * folded into one {@link DormancyVerdict} by {@link #verdict}:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>lockout</strong> — past it, the User is locked with {@link LockCause#DORMANCY}
 *       until an administrator's Unlock;
 *   <li><strong>role revocation</strong> — past it, the User's direct membership of every mapped
 *       Group is removed, so it holds no Role even if it is later unlocked.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Here, beside the state it governs, for the reason {@link LockoutPolicy} is: the rule reads
 * the User, and the dependency between the slices runs from the login surface to the directory.
 * The defaults are the domain's, not a config file's, so a deployment that configures nothing
 * and a test that constructs the policy directly agree on what "90 days" means — the pattern
 * {@code AuditRetentionPolicy} set.
 *
 * <p>The windows are ordered: role revocation is the later step. A role-revocation window not
 * longer than the lockout window would strip the Roles of a User the same run locks — or before
 * it is locked at all — which is a configuration mistake rather than a stricter policy, so it
 * stops startup like a non-positive window does.
 *
 * @param lockoutWindow        how long without authenticating before the dormancy lockout
 * @param roleRevocationWindow how long without authenticating before every mapped Group
 *                             membership is removed
