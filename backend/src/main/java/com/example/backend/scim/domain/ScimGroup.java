/**
 * A SCIM Group as the directory holds it: a display name, a set of direct User members,
 * and the version every resource carries.
 *
 * <p>A Group is how this directory expresses authority. The Admin group's membership is
 * the authorization the removed {@code role} column used to carry, which is why a Group
 * may be reserved: {@link ReservedResourceName#ADMIN_GROUP} marks the one Group that
 * cannot be renamed or deleted, and whose recovery member cannot be removed.
 *
 * <p><strong>Direct User members only.</strong> {@code members} is a list of
 * {@link ScimGroupMember}, each naming a User, and there is no representation for a Group
 * as a member — so nested and transitive membership are not unsupported by a check that
 * could be forgotten, they are unsupported because there is nothing to write them into.
 * The schema says the same thing a second way: {@code scim_group_members.user_id} has a
 * foreign key to the User table, not to the shared resource table.
 *
 * <p>Membership is de-duplicated in the canonical constructor, keeping the order the
 * connector sent. SCIM does not require {@code members} to be ordered, but a listing that
 * reshuffles between reads makes a diff-based client rewrite the resource forever, and a
 * duplicate would violate the stored pair's primary key rather than being silently
 * collapsed by the database.
 *
 * @param id             stable, non-reassignable, unique across Users and Groups
 * @param displayName    the Group's label, as submitted; what is rendered back
 * @param members        direct User members, de-duplicated, never null
 * @param reservedName   the reservation protecting this Group, or {@code null}
 * @param version        monotonic representation version, from 1
 * @param createdAt      when the resource was created, UTC
 * @param lastModifiedAt when its representation last changed, UTC
