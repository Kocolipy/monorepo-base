/**
 * Database representation of one Group membership.
 *
 * <p>Nothing but its key: a membership relates a Group to a User and carries no attribute
 * of its own, because SCIM derives every rendered sub-attribute of {@code members} other
 * than {@code value} from the referenced resource.
 *
 * <p>An entity of its own rather than a collection mapped on {@link ScimGroupEntity},
 * because membership is read and written in three different shapes that a single mapping
 * would serve badly: rendered for one Group with each member's label joined in, rendered
 * in reverse for one User, and asked as a one-row authority question at login. Each is a
 * statement over this table; none of them wants a Group's whole object graph.
 *
 * <p>The foreign keys are in the schema rather than as associations here, deliberately.
 * {@code user_id} references the User table and not the shared resource table, which is
 * what makes "direct User members only" a constraint the database enforces: a Group's id,
 * a deleted User's id and an id that names nothing are all the same violation.

     * No accessor for the id, deliberately. A membership is written and deleted, never
     * read through this entity: every read of a Group's members goes through a JPQL
     * projection on ScimGroupMemberJpaRepository that selects `m.id.userId` (or joins to
     * the User table) so it fetches exactly the columns it renders. Hibernate reads the
     * @EmbeddedId field directly, so nothing needs a getter.
