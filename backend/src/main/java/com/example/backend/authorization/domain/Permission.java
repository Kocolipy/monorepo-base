/**
 * One fine-grained power a protected action requires.
 *
 * <p>The set is CLOSED and lives here, in code, rather than in configuration: a deployment chooses
 * which Role holds which Permission, never which Permissions exist. A new Permission is a code
 * change because it only means something once a protected action declares it, and only code can
 * do that. A name in configuration that is not one of these fails startup — see
 * {@link RoleMapping} — so a typo can never silently grant nothing.
 *
 * <p>The wire and configuration spelling is {@link #value()} ({@code user:read}), not the
 * constant's name, and the order a caller is told its Permissions in is {@link #BY_VALUE}: sorted
 * by that spelling, so the order is a fact about the names and not about declaration order here.
