/**
 * Where the lockout rule's one number and the application's notion of "now" enter the
 * application. Both are beans so the rule itself stays free of configuration and of the
 * system clock.
 *
 * <p>There is no lockout duration to configure. A lock is lifted by an administrator's
 * Unlock and by nothing else, so a window would express a lift that no code performs.
 *
 * <p>Nor is the lockout-exempt identity named here. Which User must never lock is the
 * reservation marker on the seeded Bootstrap Admin's own resource row, written once by seeding
 * and reachable by no UPDATE, rather than a comparison against
 * {@code app.auth.bootstrap-username}: a rename could silently move a name, and a second
 * identity could acquire the exemption by taking it. {@code ScimSeedConfig} is the one place the
 * configured name becomes a privilege, and it does so by creating the marked row rather than by
 * leaving a name for something downstream to compare.
