/**
 * Inbound HTTP adapter for the Users projection of the Accounts page and the two operations an
 * administrator may perform on a User.
 *
 * <p>Each operation declares the Permission it requires where it is defined, with method
 * security ({@code user:read} to list, {@code user:write} for Unlock and the forced password
 * change); the application chain repeats each declaration as a URL rule, as a backstop that
 * fails closed (ADR 0010). {@code AuthorizationContractTests} proves every declaration against
 * the running application, driven by the API document.
 *
 * <p>READ-ONLY for everything the directory owns, and enforced by absence: there is no handler
 * that accepts a {@code userName}, an {@code active} flag or a Group membership, so a
 * {@code PUT}, {@code PATCH} or {@code DELETE} on a User is answered {@code 405} by the dispatcher
 * before any code here runs. The Disable and Enable actions that used to live here were removed
 * rather than hidden: {@code active} is a SCIM attribute the connector owns, so an administrator
 * overriding it would be overwritten by the next synchronization, and an endpoint kept for a
 * control nobody renders is an endpoint nobody reviews.
 *
 * <p>What remains addresses its User by the stable resource {@code id}, never by {@code userName}:
 * a connector may rename a User between the Admin reading the row and clicking, and an id-targeted
 * action cannot then land on whoever inherited the name.
 *
 * <p>{@link IdentitySummary} is returned as the wire shape rather than copied into
 * a response type of this adapter's own. The copy would have been field-identical
 * and would have had no property to enforce: the guarantee that no password hash
 * can reach a client belongs to {@code IdentitySummary}, which has no field one
 * could be written into, and a second record restating its fields only adds a
 * place for the two to drift.
