/**
 * The application chain's {@code 403}: Spring Security's own answer, after one refusal
 * record.
 *
 * <p>Two refusals reach here and are recorded apart, because they mean different things: an
 * authorization decision turning an authenticated caller away — a Permission it does not hold,
 * a route nothing declares, or a session confined by a required password change — and an
 * unsafe request arriving without its session's CSRF token, which says nothing about what the
 * caller may do. Both come here whichever layer decided: a URL rule in the chain, or a
 * handler's own method-security declaration, whose refusal the app-wide exception handler
 * hands back to the chain rather than answering itself.
 *
 * <p>An authorization refusal is also AUDITED, with the caller, the operation (method and route
 * template) and the one generic reason the log line carries. Neither record names the
 * Permission, Role or rule that refused it: a trail that did would be a map of the
 * authorization policy for whoever reads it, and the missing Permission is recoverable from
 * the operation's declaration in the API document, since each operation requires exactly one.
 * A CSRF refusal is not audited — it is not an authorization decision.
