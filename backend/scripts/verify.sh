# Baseline gate for the backend app — the one command that decides whether a
# backend change is complete. Green means the build, the tests, the ArchUnit
# rules (which run inside `verify`) and the Semgrep scan are all clean.
#
# This script is the single source of truth for what the backend baseline IS.
# The root Makefile's `verify-backend` target calls it rather than listing the
# sub-gates itself, so the Makefile and backend/AGENTS.md cannot drift apart.
#
# Conditional gates stay out of here on purpose: PIT mutation testing is scoped
# to the tests you touched, so it carries its own trigger and its own completion
# criterion. See backend/AGENTS.md.
#
# Runs from anywhere; it cd's to the app root itself.
