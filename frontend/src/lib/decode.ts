 * The primitives a response decoder is built from.

 * A successful body is the backend's claim about its contract, not a guarantee:
 * a renamed field, a `null` where a string was promised, or a proxy's HTML
 * error page all parse (or fail to) long before anything renders them. So every
 * body is read through a hand-written decoder that takes `unknown` and either
 * returns the typed value or throws `DecodeError`, and `apiFetch` turns that
 * throw into a plain `failed` result. A cast (`as T`) would let the drift
 * through to show up later as a blank cell or a crash mid-render.
 *
 * Deliberately not a schema library: the shapes are few and flat, and adding
 * one is a dependency decision of its own.
