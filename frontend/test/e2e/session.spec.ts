// other end is the only thing that proves those two statuses are what it
// actually sends. The unit suites cover the same branches against a stubbed
// `fetch`; these cover that the contract behind them is real.

// counter with authentication.spec.ts under `fullyParallel`. Both requests here
// are refused, so the count never moves.
